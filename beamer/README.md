## Setup & Configuration

### 1. Start the App
```bash
npm start
```

### 2. Google Places API (Optional but Recommended)
For enhanced location search with real address autocomplete:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the following APIs:
   - Places API
   - Geocoding API
4. Create credentials (API Key)
5. Restrict the API key to your bundle ID/package name for security
6. Add your API key to `config/environment.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export const config = {
     googlePlacesApiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
     // ... other config
   };
   ```

### 3. 3D Terrain Explorer with Satellite Imagery (No Setup Required)
The 3D terrain functionality works out of the box using:

- **Real satellite elevation data** from OpenTopoData's free SRTM dataset
- **üõ∞Ô∏è Satellite imagery overlay** from ESRI World Imagery, OpenStreetMap, and CartoDB
- **No API keys required** - uses free, open-access imagery sources with automatic fallback
- **Interactive 3D rendering** with orbital camera controls and real satellite textures
- **Advanced touch controls** - single finger rotation, two-finger pinch-to-zoom
- **Configurable terrain radius** - adjust coverage area from 1-15km with real-time reloading
- **Sun sphere visualization** - 3D sun with raycast for sunglare analysis preparation
- **Location-specific terrain** - each city shows its actual topography with satellite imagery
- **Smart camera positioning** that adapts to terrain characteristics
- **Intelligent fallback** to height-based coloring if imagery fails to load

Controls:
- **Single finger drag**: Rotate around terrain
- **Two-finger pinch**: Zoom in/out with proper scaling limits
- **Terrain Radius Slider**: Change coverage area (reloads terrain + imagery)
- **Sun Position Controls**: Adjust azimuth (0-360¬∞) and altitude (0-90¬∞)
- **Sun Toggle**: Show/hide sun sphere and raycast

Each location renders its unique 3D landscape with real satellite imagery automatically!

### 4. Usage Options

**Option A: Smart Location Search (with Google API)**
- Start typing any address or place name
- Select from intelligent autocomplete suggestions
- Automatically gets precise coordinates

**Option B: Manual Coordinates**
- Tap "Enter Coords" button next to any location field
- Enter coordinates in format: `latitude,longitude`
- Example: `37.7749,-122.4194`

**Option C: Demo Mode**
- Works out of the box without API keys
- Provides mock location suggestions for testing

## API Integration

The app connects to a FastAPI sunglare analysis server that:
- Fetches route data from Google Directions API
- Calculates sun position and horizon altitude
- Computes sunglare index for each route segment
- Returns comprehensive analysis results

**Default Server**: `http://localhost:8000`

To change the server URL, modify the `sunglareApiUrl` in `config/environment.ts`.

## Results Display

- **Route Summary**: Total distance and duration with formatted units
- **Sunglare Analysis**: Maximum index and comprehensive risk statistics
- **Route Segments**: Detailed metrics for each segment:
  - Sunglare Index (0.0 - 1.0 scale)
  - Sun Altitude in degrees
  - Sun visibility status (blocked/visible)
  - Color-coded risk levels (High/Medium/Low)
  - Location coordinates for each segment

### Google Maps Setup (Optional)
The Maps tab works with a demo route by default, but for full functionality:
1. Get a Google Maps API key from Google Cloud Console
2. Enable Maps SDK for Android/iOS and Places API
3. Add the API key to your environment configuration
4. The app gracefully falls back to basic functionality without API keys
